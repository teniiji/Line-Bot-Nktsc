// Uploading a bank statement for the daily view, with no round involved.
//
// Checking a day's money against the slips members sent has nothing to do
// with the month-end หักไม่ได้ round — it is the everyday question "did what
// arrived today match what people told us they sent". But the only route that
// wrote StatementLine was the round's, which additionally refuses unless that
// round already has a member list uploaded. So looking at one ordinary day
// meant creating a round and importing a หักไม่ได้ sheet first, neither of
// which has anything to do with the question being asked.
//
// The data was never the problem: StatementLine carries no roundId at all. It
// is keyed by account and line fingerprint precisely so a line belongs to the
// cooperative's account rather than to any round. Only the way in was
// round-shaped. This is the way in that is not.
//
// The round's own upload still stores lines exactly as before. Both paths
// write the same fingerprints, so the same file through either one refreshes
// the same rows rather than doubling them.
